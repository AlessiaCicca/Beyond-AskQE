{"id": 21, "DOC_ID": "doc19", "src": "In the work presented here, the distribution of wild boar in Switzerland was projected from grid data as probabilities of presence using an approach based on statistical modeling, separately for closed and open season for hunting. The predicted probabilities of wild boar presence were related to the density of piggeries in the six agricultural zones. The resulting maps show how the potential risk of transmission-related events, as a proxy for disease transmission, is distributed in Switzerland.", "pert_mt": "Nel lavoro qui presentato, la distribuzione dei cinghiali selvatici in Svizzera è stata proiettata dai dati della griglia come probabilità di presenza utilizzando un approccio basato su modelli statistici, separatamente per la stagione chiusa e aperta per la caccia.
